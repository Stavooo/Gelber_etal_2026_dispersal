# Model Output Data

This directory should contain raw simulation output data downloaded from Zenodo.

Expected subfolder structure:
- `96/`  Varying autocorrelation (continuous landscape, Figure 2)
- `97/`  Varying disturbance (continuous landscape, Figure 2)
- `99/`  Varying fragmentation (modified landscape, Figure 2)
- `100/`  Varying habitat amount (modified landscape, Figure 2)
- `101/`  Habitat x Disturbance x Autocorrelation in modified landscape (Figures 5--7)
- `102/`  Autocorrelation x Disturbance in continuous landscape (Figure 3)
- `103/`  Habitat x Fragmentation in modified landscape (Figure 4)
- `104/`  Full factorial modified landscape, set A (Appendix Figures S1, S3)
- `105/`  Full factorial modified landscape, set B (Appendix Figures S2, S4)

Each subfolder contains CSV files with model output (general, dispersal, sample)
and parameter files (static_parameters, varaying_parameters).
